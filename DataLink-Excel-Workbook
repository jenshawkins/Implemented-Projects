Smaller pivot tables, to reduce unncessary colunns and only show the items needed to answer required question for those that did not want to use the search feature. Conditional formatting to let you know if a duplicate was found so you would not add in error.

Links that connect and show you if a matching contract exists by client name, number, and type of contract.

Additional links necessary for each section to eliminate confusion.

Excel Formulas:

1) For Y/N:

=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(I5,'External Microsoft Teams Channe'!$D$2:$D$517,0)), "Yes", "No"), added conditional formatting for Yes (green), No (red)


2) To display value from another sheet:

=IFERROR(INDEX(Source_Data!Z1:Z4926, MATCH(I5, Source_Data!F1:F4926, 0)), "Not listed")

=INDEX(Source_Data!$S$2:$S$4927, MATCH(G5, Source_Data!$E$2:$E$4927, 0))
 

3) For Product Line match to Group/Subgroup: 

=IFERROR(INDEX('Product Master 1'!$B$1:$B$1934,MATCH(F8,'Product Master 1'!$E$1:$E$1934,0)),"")


4) To show results if a contract is there and add the name of contract: 

=IFERROR(INDEX('Client Profile_Agreement Links'!J2:J687, MATCH(I5, 'Client Profile_Agreement Links'!F2:F687, 0)), "Search MShare")


5) Created a search box tool (like Google Search) that comes back with results as long as name appears:

=IFERROR(FILTER(Table715, ISNUMBER(SEARCH(K12,Table715[Product Subgroup])),"Check Product Master Search"), "Check Product Master Search")

 
6) Conditional formatting if found a match:

=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(V13,$F$2:$F$517,0)), "Already Added or Add to 'Actual Prod Sub-Group'", "No Exact Match")

 
7) Email automation with email and subject line added, when pressed, an email opens with the person's email and includes a subject line:

=HYPERLINK(mailto: & AA8 & "?Subject=No Agreement/No Billing", "Send email")

=HYPERLINK(mailto: & AA7& "?Subject=Client Profile | Validation Call Prep", "Send email")



Tool Solved the Following Business Problems:


1) Each team member had to pull their own billing reports from Oracle, with this tool this was no longer necessary for them to do. The tool is an empty shell, so the solution was to intergrate everyone's biling report by sprint so anyone on the team could use it for that sprint.

2) No longer have to look up one-by-one every line of coverage to find the correct group for billing items.

3) This immediately answers other questions such as if international was involved without having to look it up.

4) If available, you’ll be able to see the digital version of the agreement information immediately as you change the client name.

5) Have the ability to quickly see which items match already from the agreement and the billing so you don’t add duplicates onto your scope of services

6) A quick look up option for each line of coverage if the product is not available from the billing or the agreement

7) All you have to do is select your client name and everything will populate, including your coverages, your account owner, your email, subject line, and all of the questions that you used to manually have to look up

8) This tool populates your contracts so you can quickly see what type of agreement contract to know how to proceed

9) Includes all your links for every place you need to visit for information, and in the email section where you would update your subject section is prefilled

10) The product search option allows you to find every single keyword that matches what you’re typing and it will immediately tell you if you have a duplicate, it will tell you what the product product line should be for that, it will tell you if nothing could be found and what to do next
