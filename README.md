Project 1-1 image  (Legend) is located next to the images
Project 1-2 image (below the 1-1 image) each of the y/n is searching attached Sharepoint files and scanning them for client name immediately after pivot table (name of client is changed)

Project 1 image is a custom search bar, that provides the search values of anything typed in the search box that matches (it includes those that are not exact match but contains the same part of the keyword typed)

Project 2 image are additional custom pivot tables to look up certain criteria needed to answer workbook questions quickly without having to look at another excel file.

Project 3 image is an email automation option, on the left side will display the days the emails will need to go out. On the right when the link is selected an email is started with the connected email (that also changes by client name/pivot table) so you can immediately email that client and also includes subject lines.
